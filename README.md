## Ingredients in NativePath Native Hydrate
A supplement’s effectiveness depends largely on its ingredients. NativePath Native Hydrate contains a powerful mix of key elements:

•	Coconut Water Powder:- Known for its high electrolyte content, coconut water is packed with potassium, sodium, and magnesium—essential minerals that help keep you hydrated and balanced during exercise.

•	Himalayan Pink Salt:- Unlike regular salt, Himalayan pink salt contains a wide range of minerals such as calcium, potassium, and magnesium that help maintain fluid balance in the body, making it ideal for hydration.

•	Magnesium:- This essential mineral plays a crucial role in muscle and nerve function while also helping your cells absorb water. Magnesium enhances hydration retention, reducing muscle fatigue and cramps.

•	Potassium:- Potassium is another key electrolyte that supports fluid balance, muscle function, and nerve signaling. It’s crucial for staying hydrated and keeping energy levels steady.

•	Vitamin C:- Famous for its immune-boosting properties, vitamin C also helps with hydration at the cellular level. It supports recovery and reduces inflammation after physical exertion.

•	Natural Flavors:- NativePath Native Hydrate uses natural flavors to enhance taste, ensuring you get a refreshing experience without any artificial sweeteners or colorings.
